本作品以俚語”cheap as chips”作為發想，透過衍生藝術形式，模擬印刷電路板的圖紋和底色。晶片或薯片，孰輕孰重？當著色器與民國58年攝錄的甘薯種植影像並置，臺灣經濟發展的過去和未來順勢展開對話。

This work is inspired by the slang "cheap as chips" and employs generative art to simulate the patterns and colors of printed circuit boards. Chips or potato chips? That is the question. When the shader is juxtaposed with footage of sweet potato cultivation filmed in 1969, a dialogue between the past and future of Taiwan's economic development unfolds.
